# LiteBIRD likelihood following approach of the CORE-M5 papers
# for the M5 ESA proposal: Di Valentino et al. 1612.00021 and
# Finelli et al. 1612.08270.

# This likelihood builds on the fake planck bluebook likelihood,
# modified by T. Brinckmann and S. Clesse to include B-modes and
# the CMB lensing potential. It is possible to use the lensing
# auto- or cross-correlations alone, in combination with temperature
# and polarization, or for delensing the temperature and polarization
# spectra (e.g. if both lensing and B-mode polarization is desired)

# Noise spectrum using minimum variance noise estimate
# from Brinckmann, Hooper et al. 1808.05955 based on
# LiteBIRD mission paper Suzuki et al. 1801.06987

# Where to read/write fiducial model:

# Experimental sensitivity:

# Angular resolution
# theta_fwhm must be in in arcmin
# LiteBIRD mission paper indicated one channel in GHz [140]
# FWHM taken from LiteBIRD settings in CORE-M5 papers
# (1612.00021 and 1612.08270) for this channel
litebird.theta_fwhm = [31.0]

# Resolution for Temperature and Polarisation
